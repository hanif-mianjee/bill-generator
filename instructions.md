# You are creative principal UI/UX engineer. 

I create two cash memo bills for medical and to for travel allowance. I printed copies and fill in the details.
Please create a html form that ask for customer name, date, and total bill amount and generate a basic bill.
Particular sould be automatically selected from predefined list of medicines based on the total bill amount.
A bill preview should be displayed under the form with a download as pdf button that can download the bill in pdf.
The page should also have cycle template button that change the bill template from a list 20 predefined template designs.
